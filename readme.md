DronePwn
==========
This is a bash script based on the idea Darren Kitchen propesed for connecting to AR drones and killing processes.

This script has a few differences from the one demonstrated on that episode:
  - It is written for OS X, not OpenWRT
  - It supports multiple drone access points
  - It will send SIGKILL to all running processes, not just the control one

I don't take credit for any of the ideas in this script
